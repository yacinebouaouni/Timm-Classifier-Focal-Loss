# Timm-Classifier-Focal-Loss

## Overview

This repository provides a flexible framework for training and testing classifiers using the Timm library from Hugging Face. It's designed to streamline the process of building and fine-tuning classification models for various tasks. The code is highly configurable through a dedicated configuration file, allowing you to experiment with different hyperparameters and architectures effortlessly.

## Features

- **Flexibility**: Easily adapt the code to your specific classification task by configuring hyperparameters, model architectures, and training settings through a single configuration file.

- **Focal Loss**: This repository includes an implementation of the Focal Loss, a specialized loss function that enhances the training of models for imbalanced classification problems.

- **TensorBoard Integration**: Visualize training progress, loss curves, and evaluation metrics using TensorFlow's TensorBoard for better insights into model performance.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with training and testing classifiers:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yacinebouaouni/Timm-Classifier-Focal-Loss.git

## Configuration
The config.yaml file serves as the central configuration hub for your experiments. You can adjust various settings, including:

* Dataset paths and preprocessing.
* Model architecture and hyperparameters.
* Training settings (batch size, learning rate, etc.).
* Focal Loss parameters (gamma and alpha).
* Logging and saving options.
* Evaluation metrics and thresholds.
* Customize the configuration file according to your specific task and experimentation goals.
